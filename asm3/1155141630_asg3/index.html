<h1>Challenge Requirements</h1>

<h3>Query No</h3>
<p>
    It is implemented by cookie, with maxAge 300,000. <br>
    In every successful GET requests, the query no follows with the mongoose results, splitted by a comma. <br>
    For example, [],{"query_no":3}.<br>
    The failed requests are also counted but not displayed.</p>

<h3>GraphQL</h3>

<p>This part uses GraphQL to fetch the information of events and locations. <br>
    It is implemented by Apollo Server and tested by Apollo sandbox.<br>
    The sandbox is in https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox/explorer.<br>
    My graphql API is in http://localhost:3000/graphql.<br>
    The following is the tested query operations.
